# Lighting Optimization Simulation â€“ MATLAB Engineering Toolkit

This project simulates indoor lighting using multiple point sources in MATLAB. It calculates light intensity at any point on the floor using the inverse square law and visualizes it through 2D and 3D plots.

## Features
- Simulates 1, 2, and 3 light bulb setups
- Computes intensity using parametric functions and Euclidean distance
- Generates heatmaps using `contourf` and 3D surfaces using `meshgrid` and `surf`
- Demonstrates symmetry-based lighting optimization

## Tools & Libraries
- MATLAB core functions: `contourf`, `meshgrid`, `surf`, `sqrt`, `hold on`, `axis equal`
- Physics: Inverse Square Law
- Vector calculus and matrix operations

## Output
- Heatmaps showing light distribution
- 3D surface plots for light intensity mapping
- Comparative analysis between different lighting configurations
